# PyBer_Analysis
Analyze and Visualize ride-sharing data using the power of Python, Pandas and Matplotlib

## Overview of the Analysis
   PyBer is a Python-based ride-sharing app company and we did an analysis on data using a large number of CSV file and created several types of visualization using different charts that showcased the relationship between the type of cities and the number of drivers and riders. This analysis helped Pyber to improve access to ride-sharing service app and determine affordability for the underserved neighborhood. 

   Now V. Isualize (co-founder of PyBer) has given us a brand-new assignment. Using our Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, we have to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we will create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results
1) Total rides for each city type was 

Rural    - 125
Suburbun - 625
Urban    - 1625
